_______________________________________________________________________
**
You need to use a cdn to turn server IP anonymous, never reveal/disclose/show your real server ip to the customer or client, if you want to use cloudflare cdn without caching just disable cache on cloudflare and turn on proxy (Orange Cloud) on your dns. For insecure connection you should use a nginx reverse proxy to handle http connection from a bullet/NoDMCA Compliant hosting company, in other words We reserve the action to suspend or terminate any person who are not proxyng the streams before received from the client.

## Final Steps:

To get your access codes and the url needed you just need to use the following.

Type this on your terminal.

```bash
/home/xui/tools migration
```

```
